# Customer Personality Analysis

**Description**

We have selected a data set from Kaggle.

**Data Cleaning and Wrangling** </br>
- Dataset was clean on SQL for the most part</br>
- The cleaning was oriented towards: Column renaming, dropping off unecessary columns, dealing with null values</br>
- Additional minor cleaning has been made for each hypothesis on Python</br>
